# Follow the mouse

Game mechanic for the movement of a character with a "hammer" like object attached to it with a spring.
The character follows cursor movement, and the attached "hammer" follows the character.

This project is used to test the game mechanic in isolation, so settings, parameters and other things can be tweaked to test how it feels.
